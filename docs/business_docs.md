### Insurance Analytics
How Insurance Works (the Analyst's Perspective)
- Risk Transfer: Individuals transfer financial risk to an insurer
- Risk Pooling: Insurers collect premiums from many to cover the losses of a few
- The Data connection: Every premium, every claim, every policy detail generates data - this is our raw material for analysis
- The Cycle: Data informs risk assessment -> Risk assessment informs pricing -> Premiums collected -> Claims paid -> More data generated.

**Why do we need data analytics in the insurance industry?**
- Analyze a customer's risk and determine which client is trustworthy or may cause great loss
- Analytics create new capabilities that empower insurers to optimize every function in the insurance value chain with the help of data-driven decision-making
- It can also detect fraud, through which the greatest frauds happen
- Customers can use data analytics to know which insurance company gives a minimum price with suitable offers.

### Types of Insurance Analytics

#### 1. Descriptive Analysis
Descriptive analytics answer the question, "What happened?" This type of analytics is by far the most commonly used by customers, providing reporting and analysis centered on past events. It helps companies understand things such as:

- In this project, descriptive analysis would involve examining historical insurance claim data to understand past trends in claim frequency, claim amounts, types of claims, customer demographics, geographical patterns, etc. This analysis provides a baseline understanding of past performance and helps identify potential areas for improvement in the marketing strategy.

#### 2. Diagnostic Analytics
Diagnostic analytics, just like descriptive analytics, uses historical data to answer a question. But instead of focusing on "the what", diagnostic analytics addresses the critical question of why an occurrence or anomaly occurred within your data. Diagnostic analytics also happen to be the most overlooked and skipped step within the analytics maturity model. Anecdotally, most customers attempt to go from "what happened" to "what will happen" without ever taking the time to address the "why did it happen" step. This type of analytics helps companies answer questions such as why an event or anomaly occurred in the data.

#### 3. Predictive Analysis
Predictive analysis is a form of advanced analytics that determines what is likely to happen based on historical data using machine learning.

**How To Get Started with Predictive Analytics?**

At the outset of any predictive analytics build, three core elements need to be established:

    Identify a problem to solve,
    Define what it is you want to predict, and
    State what you will achieve by doing so.

#### 4. Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics is the fourth, and final pillar of modern analytics. Prescriptive analytics pertains to true guided analytics where your analytics is prescribing or guiding you toward a specific action to take. It is effectively the merging of descriptive, diagnostic, and predictive analytics to drive decision making.

- Prescriptive anallystics primary aim is to take the educated guess or assessment out of data analystics and streamline the decision-making process
